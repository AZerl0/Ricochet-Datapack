### How to Obtain

-   Available through enchanting tables, chest loot in structures, and librarian trades.
-   Special method: hitting a slime with a book gives a 15% chance to apply the Ricochet enchantment.
    -   If the book already has the enchantment, its level increases by 1 up to the maximum.

### Enchantment Overview

-   Can be applied to bows and crossbows.
-   Arrows bounce off blocks when the enchantment is applied.
-   Maximum level: 5. Higher levels allow more ricochets:
    -   Level 1: 1 ricochet
    -   Level 2: 4 ricochets
    -   Level 5: 25 ricochets
-   Ricochets are calculated as `x = lvl ^ 2`.
